Android-ParallaxScrollView
==========================

A Parallax [ScrollView](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ScrollView.html) for Android. Mimics the behavior of the album view in the Google Play Music application.

## Integration
Integrating is as easy as replacing a ScrollView with the ParallaxScrollView and setting a view reference.

    <se.jmvo.widget.
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        android:fillViewport="true"
        app:backgroundView="@+id/imageView"
        app:scrollFactor="0.6"
        android:id="@+id/scrollView">

        ...

    </se.jmvo.widget.ParallaxScrollView>

The child view of the ParallaxScrollView with the reference id set by the attribute
`app:backgroundView` will be used for parallax scrolling. The amount of scrolling can be set
using the attribute `app:scrollFactor`. It is also possible to change these values from the code.

    parallaxScrollView.setBackgroundView(resId);
    parallaxScrollView.setBackgroundView(view);

    parallaxScrollView.setScrollFactor(float);

See the sample project for more information.
